IRM-M5

This is a repository containing Milestone5.sh and RUG.html.

Milestone5.sh is a bash script that computes the amount of times the word 'de' occurs in any given Wikipedia page. 
Its usage and the ways in which it works can be found in the Milestone5.sh file's comments.

RUG.html is the HTML of the RUG Wikipedia page. It has been downloaded directly from this webpage: https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rijksuniversiteit_Groningen . 
This has been done using the 'save as' feature, which downloads a page's HTML and other files. 
Only the .html file is needed for this script. Other files (such as .png files) might be discarded.

When applied to RUG.html, Milestone5.sh outputs 182. This means there are 182 occurences of the word 'de' on the RUG Wikipedia page.
